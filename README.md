# Pine-hyperspectral-image-segmentaion 

**Pine_segmentation** is the accompanying code for a scientific publication XXX that involves the segmentation of hyperspectral images of pine seedlings. The data for this project comes from the Drásov Phenotyping Unit (PSI).

## Description

This repository contains a set of R scripts and data files used in the analysis and segmentation of hyperspectral images of pine trees. These images are part of a study conducted at the Drásov Phenotyping Unit, operated by Photon Systems Instruments (PSI), which specializes in advanced phenotyping systems and high-end instrumentation for plant science research.


## Usage
Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following software and libraries installed:

- R (tested on R version 4.1.2 Bird Hippie)
- Required R packages: 'caTools', 'stringr'

To use the scripts, follow these steps:

1. Download test data at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h0VPsPvlxm2rjUBtWN54SmitcWxt50RG?usp=sharing
2. Ensure all data files are placed in the appropriate directories as specified in the scripts.
3. Open R and set the working directory to the repository folder.
